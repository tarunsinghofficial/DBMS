Main Features of DBMS
Some of the significant features of database management software include:

·       Low Repetition and Redundancy
In a database, the chances of data duplication are quite high as several users use one database. A DBMS reduces data repetition and redundancy by creating a single data repository that can be accessed by multiple users, even allowing easy data mapping while performing ETL.

·       Easy Maintenance of Large Databases
Most organizational data is stored in large databases. A DBMS helps maintain these databases by enforcing user-defined validation and integrity constraints, such as user-based access.

·       Enhanced Security
When handling large amounts of data, security becomes the top-most concern for all businesses. A database management software doesn’t allow full access to anyone except the database administrator or the departmental head. Only they can modify the database and control user access, making the database more secure. All other users are restricted, depending on their access level.

·       Improved File Consistency
By implementing a database management system, organizations can create a standardized way to use files and ensure consistency of data with other systems and applications. This streamlines data management and manipulation because the same rules can be applied to all the data throughout the organization.

·       Multi-User Environment Support
A database management software features and supports a multi-user environment, allowing several users to access and work on data concurrently. It also supports several views of the data. A view is a subsection of a database that’s distinct and dedicated for specific operators of the system.

As a database is typically accessed by multiple operators simultaneously, these operators may need different database views. For example, operator A may want to print a bank statement, whereas Operator B would want to only check the bank balance. Although both are querying the same database, they will be presented with different views.
